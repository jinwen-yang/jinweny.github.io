About me
====
I am a PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uchicago.edu/) at University of Chicago. My advisor is [Haihao (Sean) Lu](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/haihao-lu). Previously, I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Fudan University. 

My research involves developing computational and mathematical methods for solving large-scale optimization problems in data science, machine learning, and operations research, with a focus on first-order methods for large-scale constrained continuous optimization, and computational tools utilizing GPUs and distributed systems.
