About me
====
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago](https://stat.uchicago.edu/).

I'm broadly interested in multiple testing, concept control for generative models, causal inference with machine learning, and more recently, alignment for large language models. I'm currently working with Professor [Jingshu Wang](https://jingshuw.org/) on statistical inference problems and Professor [Victor Veitch](http://victorveitch.com/) on concept control for score-based conditional models.
 
Previously, I received my master's degree in statistics at the University of Chicago. Prior to UChicago, I was an undergraduate student at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).
