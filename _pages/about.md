About me
====
I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago](https://stat.uchicago.edu/).

I'm broadly interested in statistical inference, causal inference with machine learning, large text-controlled vision models, and biostatistics. I'm currently working with Professor [Jingshu Wang](https://jingshuw.org/) on statistical inference problems and Professor [Victor Veitch](http://victorveitch.com/) on concept control for text-to-image models.
 
Previously, I received my master's degree in statistics at the University of Chicago. Prior to UChicago, I was an undergraduate student at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).
