About me
====
I am a second year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago](https://stat.uchicago.edu/).

I'm broadly interested in selective inference and causal inference with machine learning. I'm currently working with Professor [Jingshu Wang](https://jingshuw.org/) on statistical inference problems and Professor [Victor Veitch](http://victorveitch.com/) on causal inference with the text data.

Previously, I received my master's degree in statistics at the University of Chicago. Prior to UChicago, I was an undergradute student in University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).
